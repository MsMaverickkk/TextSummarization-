# TextSummarization-
Summarizing the text using textrank and lexrank algorithms

1. In this project i've used various natural language processing techniques and libraries
such as Spacy, NLTK, Gensim and Sumy to perform text summarization

2. Text Summarization using Flask has many potential applications, such as helping
individuals and businesses quickly process large amounts of text data, summarizing news
articles, and summarizing legal or medical documents. With this project we aim to provide a
user friendly and efficient tool for text summarization using Flask and NLP

3. The Problem Statement for this project is to develop a flexible, customizable, and efficient text
summarization tool that can quickly and accurately summarize large amounts of text data.

<h3>Procedure</h3>
1. Create virtual environemnt as the libraries used in the project is version sensitive
To install the required packages, run:

```bash
python -m venv v_env 
```
2. Install the requirements mentioned in the requirements.txt file
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the falsk application
```bash
python app.py
```


<h3>Scope and Limitations</h3>
<ol>
<li>User input errors: The accuracy of the summaries produced may be affected by errors in user input, such as spelling mistakes or incorrect grammar.</li>
<li>Not suitable for multi-level file summarization</li>
<li>Redundancy in summarized data</li>
<li>ROGUE measure of the summarized data is less due to the entropy in the text provided</li>
</ol>
